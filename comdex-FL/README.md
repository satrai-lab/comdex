# ComDeX Federated Learning (FL) Extension

Here you can find the federated learning extension of [ComDeX].

ðŸ“š **Documentation & Wiki**: Full setup instructions, configuration details, and examples will be made available soon. Documentation is currently under development.

This extension enables smart communities to collaboratively train machine learning models across distributed datasets **without exposing raw data**. It builds upon ComDeXâ€™s existing advertisement-based architecture to support:

- **Dynamic FL Task Discovery**: FL tasks and FL Participants can be advertised and discovered across brokers.
- **Flexible Participant Enrollment**: Supports client-driven, server-driven, and hybrid discovery paradigms.
- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Integrates with the Flower framework to perform secure model training and aggregation.
